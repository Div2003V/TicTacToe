📌 What is Tic Tac Toe?
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and popular two-player game. The game board has 3 rows and 3 columns. Each player chooses either X or O and takes turns placing their mark in one of the empty boxes.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 boxes are filled and no one has won, it's a draw.

🧠 How to Play
The game will tell you whose turn it is (Player X starts first).

Click on a blank box to place your mark.

If someone wins, the winning boxes turn green, and a pop-up appears.

If it's a draw, the game will also show a pop-up.

Click Reset Game to clear the board and play again.

The scoreboard below the board keeps track of wins and draws.

❓ Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Do I need to install any libraries?
A: No. tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so nothing extra is needed.

Q: Can I play against the computer?
A: Not in this version. This is a two-player game on the same device.

Q: Can I restart the score?
A: The scores reset only when you close and reopen the app. You can also manually reset them by changing the code if needed.

🧑‍💻 Future Improvements (Ideas)
Add single-player mode with AI

Let players choose their symbols and colors

Save scores across game sessions

Add sound effects when buttons are clicked
